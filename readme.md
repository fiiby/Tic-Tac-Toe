# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a basic implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. It's a two-player game where each player takes turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

# How to Play:
1- Game Board: You'll see the game board represented as a 3x3 grid. Each cell is numbered from 1 to 9. 
2- Players take turns entering the number of the cell where they want to place their mark.
3- Gameplay: The first player chooses a cell, then the second player does the same. This continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
4- Winning: If a player gets three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win the game.
5- Draw: If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
6- Repeat: You can choose to play again after the game ends.
